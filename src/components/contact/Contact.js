                            <h4>I am a 28 years old frontend-developer student,      graduating October 2020. I am based in TÃ¸nsberg, Norway.</h4>
                            <p>From my education I have gained experience in HTML 5, CSS 3, SASS, JavaScript and React.</p>

                            <p>My previous work experience is customer service, which I liked, as I got to work with people. I like to understand other people's perspectives, see their needs and help them achieve those thoughts and goals. These are qualities I always want to evolve and make use of as I am turning into a greate frontend-developer. I have a passion to create and solve problems, and therefore I know I will be a good developer. I am currently in training and loving it!</p>

                            <p>Hope you like what you are seeing and if you have any questions or you just like what you just saw, please contact me by email or number. </p>

                            <p>Looking forward to hear from you!</p>
